        information: "2.Create a strong and easy-to-remember password:      Passwords are one of the biggest weak spots in the whole Internet security structure,but there's currently no way around them. And the problem with passwords is that people tend to choose easy ones to remember (such as 'password' and '123456'),which are also easy for cyber thieves to guess.Select strong passwords that are harder for cybercriminals to demystify. Password manager software can help you to manage multiple passwords so that you don't forget them.A strong password is one that is unique and complex—at least 15 characters long, mixing letters, numbers and special characters.",

They do need to know about your expertise and professional background, and how to get in touch with you.

Be Careful What You Download: A top goal of cybercriminals is to trick you into downloading malware—programs or apps that carry malware or try to steal information.

As InfoWorld reports, fake social media profiles are a popular way for hackers to cozy up to unwary Web users and pick their cyber pockets. Be as cautious and sensible in your online social life as you are in your in-person social life.",
